## Claim gate

Scope: lowest statistically supported geometric-mean latency on complete decoded and raw-input comparable suites.

Met: **false**.

- jsonata-go is not statistically faster than gnata for bytes (upper 95% ratio 1.793)

## Method

Each implementation/case/mode passed the pinned oracle before it was registered as a benchmark. Collection rotates implementation order each round. Latencies use geometric means over log-transformed repeated estimates. Ratio intervals use a two-sided 95% normal interval over independent log measurements; a claim requires the upper workspace/competitor bound to be below 1 for every competitor in both decoded and raw-input suites. Allocation columns are arithmetic means. Raw-input measurements call each library's public raw-input API directly; return representation is library-specific. Size tiers use serialized input size: small is at most 128 bytes, medium is 129-512 bytes, and large is at least 513 bytes. Unsupported cells are listed above and excluded from timing and claims.

Raw output is in [`raw/`](raw/). Pairwise `benchstat` output is in [`benchstat.txt`](benchstat.txt).
CPU, allocation, mutex, and blocking evidence is in [`profiles/`](profiles/). Hardware cache counters were unavailable on this host, so no cache claim is made.
